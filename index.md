Hi, welcome to my personal website. I'm Rory, a software engineer and open
source developer.

I have been working as a software engineer for four years and have been writing
code for even longer than that. Prior to that I was working as a manager at a
rock climbing gym.

I have a broad range of experience in software engineering, most recently as a
full stack web developer using ASP.NET with C# on the backend, React with
TypeScript on the frontend, and a MySQL database.

In addition I have extensive experience with Python for both scripting and web
development. Rust is currently my language of choice for personal projects.

## Skills

**Backend** \| C#, ASP.NET, Python, Rust<br />
**Frontend** \| TypeScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS<br />
**Databases** \| MySQL, SQL Server, AWS - RDS<br />
**Cloud** \| AWS, SQS, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, EC2<br />
**Soft skills** \| Cross-team communication, Mentoring, Team player<br />

I am looking for roles in backend web development. For more information about me
see the links below.
