Here you will find a list of personal and open-source projects that I have
worked on over the years.

## Avy

- **Dates:** January 2025 - present
- **Link:** [https://github.com/NWACus/avy](https://github.com/NWACus/avy)
- **Skills:** TypeScript, React-Native, Collaboration

Avy is an open-source mobile application for avalanche forecasts created by the
Northwest Avalanche Centre (NWAC). I have been volunteering for NWAC, helping
them maintain the app. The app provides avalanche forecasts and weather data
from various avalanche centers in the US. It is used by thousands of people for
backcountry skiing and other winter activities.

The app is built on React Native and targets Android and iOS.

## Dry Rock

- **Dates:** April 2020 - present
- **Link:** [https://dryrock.ie/](https://dryrock.ie/)
- **Skills:** Python, HTML, CSS

Dry Rock is an open source weather website for rock climbers. The main problem
it is trying to solve is "where should I go climbing this weekend"?

With rock climbing, as with any outdoor activity, the weather plays a crucial
roll. This often led me to checking the forecast for multiple different places,
trying to compare them to each other and figure out where was going to have the
best weather. Thus Dry Rock was born!

It is designed for high information density so that you can quickly
figure out where the best weather to go climbing is with the least amount of
effort. It is also specifically designed to work well on mobile devices because
that is often how I end up using it.

It is built with Python which renders static HTML pages that are then served
using GitHub Pages. Created and maintained by me.

## Rust Ray Tracer

- **Dates:** April 2023 - April 2025
- **Link:** [https://github.com/Rory-Sullivan/rs_ray_tracer](https://github.com/Rory-Sullivan/rs_ray_tracer)
- **Skills:** Rust, Computer graphics

This is a passion project to build a ray tracing engine from scratch.

I've always been interested 3D graphics, mostly thanks to video games but I
became interested in ray tracing in particular when I took a module all about
the math behind it in college. To me it was a fun blend of math, physics, and
computers, all of which I am very interested in.

Later when I was learning Rust (a new programming language) I was looking for a
good compute intensive project to test my skills and ray tracing seemed like a
good candidate.

It's based on the 'Ray tracing in one weekend' book series, which takes you
through how to build a simple ray tracing engine from scratch in C++, though my
project was all written in Rust. It runs on the CPU so it is not very fast, but
given enough time it can produce some cool images.

## Met Norway Location Forecast

- **Dates:** July 2020 - present
- **Link:** [https://github.com/Rory-Sullivan/metno-locationforecast](https://github.com/Rory-Sullivan/metno-locationforecast)
- **Skills:** Python

An open-source Python library for interfacing with MET Norway's
Locationforecast/2.0 service. Created and maintained by me. Officially
recommended by Met Norway.

## Hexagonal Path Finding Visualiser

![Hexagonal path finding visualiser demo image](/assets/images/hexagonal_path_finding_visualiser.png)

- **Dates:** March 2020 - April 2020
- **Link:** [https://rory-sullivan.github.io/Hexagonal-Path-Finding-Visualiser/](https://rory-sullivan.github.io/Hexagonal-Path-Finding-Visualiser/)
- **Skills:** JavaScript, Computer graphics, Algorithms


This project is a visual representation of various path finding algorithms on a
hexagonal grid. I built this as a tool to help me understand how path finding
algorithms work.
